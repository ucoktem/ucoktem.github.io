								I am a 5th year Physics PhD student  under Jaroslav Trnka in the UC Davis Fields, Strings, and Gravity Group. My field of study is high energy theory and my main interests are in questions that lie at the intersection of quantum field theory, symmetries, mathematics, and physics of the real world. I got my B.S. in Physics from UC Santa Barbara in 2020 and started my PhD in UC Davis the same year.
							</p>
							<p>
								Bulk of my PhD work has been under the rapidly growing field of QFT scattering amplitudes. Recent progress in this direction has shown that development of novel methods for computing scattering amplitudes leads to the discovery of new features of the underlying theory, which in turn can be used to compute amplitudes more efficiently,  creating what has been dubbed a virtuous cycle. Thus, modern amplitudes research is relevant for various areas of active investigation, ranging from collider physics to gravitational waves and pure mathematics. 
							</p>
							<p>
								 As part of my (ongoing) dissertation, I have studied the analytical properites and constraints from symmetries of the amplitudes in theories such as Supersymmetric Yang-Mills, scalar EFTs, and gravity. In addition to amplitudes, I am broadly interested in using symmetry driven techniques and bootstrap methods to study physical systems more efficiently across various scales.
							</p>
							<p>
								Outside of physics, I spend my free time on hiking, powerlifting, reading about history, and wildife rehab.
